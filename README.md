# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System developed in Java, featuring a user-friendly interface for managing book records.

## View Functionality

The view function allows users to see the existing book records stored in the library database. Here's how it works:

1. *User Interface*: The GUI displays a table that lists all the existing book records, including details such as ISBN, book name, author, and publisher.

2. *Data Retrieval*: Upon launching the application or clicking a refresh button, the system retrieves the book records from the database and populates the table.

3. *Interaction*: Users can scroll through the table to view all the book records currently stored in the library.


## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (GUI Toolkit)
- MySQL
